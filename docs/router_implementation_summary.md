# Policy-Driven Router Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the completed implementation of the Policy-Driven Routing system for Symbiont's SLM-first architecture. The system intelligently routes requests between Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) based on configurable policies, task classification, and confidence monitoring.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The routing system has been fully implemented and integrated with all major Symbiont components.

### ✅ Core Components Implemented

1. **RoutingEngine Trait & DefaultRoutingEngine** (`crates/runtime/src/routing/engine.rs`)
   - Async trait-based architecture for pluggable routing implementations
   - DefaultRoutingEngine with comprehensive routing logic
   - Integration with ModelCatalog for SLM selection

2. **Policy Evaluation Engine** (`crates/runtime/src/routing/policy.rs`)
   - Configurable policy rules with priority-based matching
   - Multiple condition types (TaskType, ContentLength, TimeOfDay, etc.)
   - Policy actions for routing decisions (PreferSLM, RequireLLM, Skip)

3. **Task Classification System** (`crates/runtime/src/routing/classifier.rs`)
   - Automatic task type detection using keyword and regex patterns
   - Support for 10+ task types (Intent, Extract, CodeGeneration, etc.)
   - Complexity level assignment for routing decisions

4. **Confidence Monitoring** (`crates/runtime/src/routing/confidence.rs`)
   - Thread-safe confidence tracking with Arc<RwLock<>>
   - Heuristic-based confidence evaluation
   - Historical tracking for adaptive learning

5. **Routing Configuration** (`crates/runtime/src/routing/config.rs`)
   - Complete TOML-serializable configuration schema
   - Hierarchical policy rules and threshold configuration
   - Runtime-configurable routing behavior

6. **Core Decision Types** (`crates/runtime/src/routing/decision.rs`)
   - RoutingContext for request metadata
   - RouteDecision with detailed reasoning
   - ModelRequest/Response types for execution

7. **Comprehensive Error Handling** (`crates/runtime/src/routing/error.rs`)
   - 15+ specific error types with severity levels
   - Retryable error classification
   - Conversion traits for external error types

### ✅ System Integration Points

1. **Scheduler Integration** (`crates/runtime/src/scheduler/mod.rs`)
   - Added optional routing_engine field to DefaultAgentScheduler
   - Constructor methods for routing-enabled schedulers

2. **Tool Invocation Integration** (`crates/runtime/src/integrations/tool_invocation.rs`)
   - Enhanced DefaultToolInvocationEnforcer with routing capability
   - Tool-specific task classification logic
   - Routing decision logging and metadata

3. **Configuration Integration** (`crates/runtime/src/config.rs`)
   - Added routing configuration to main Config struct
   - Validation and serialization support

4. **Module Exports** (`crates/runtime/src/lib.rs`)
   - Complete routing module re-exports
   - Public API for external integration

### ✅ Key Features Delivered

- **SLM-First Architecture**: Intelligent preference for SLMs with LLM fallback
- **Policy-Driven Decisions**: Configurable rules engine with priority ordering
- **Task-Aware Routing**: Automatic classification and capability matching
- **Confidence-Based Quality**: Adaptive learning from execution results
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Full async/await support with proper concurrency
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed audit trail of routing decisions
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback mechanisms with retry logic
- **Runtime Configuration**: Dynamic policy updates and threshold adjustments

### ✅ Technical Architecture

```
RoutingEngine
├── TaskClassifier → TaskType classification
├── PolicyEvaluator → Rule-based decision logic  
├── ConfidenceMonitor → Quality tracking & thresholds
└── ModelCatalog → SLM selection & capability matching
    ↓
RouteDecision
├── ModelSelection::SLM → Execute with selected SLM
├── ModelSelection::LLM → Fallback to LLM provider
└── ModelSelection::Skip → Skip execution with reason
```

### ✅ Configuration Schema

The system supports comprehensive TOML configuration with:
- Global routing policies with priority ordering
- Confidence thresholds for quality control
- Task-specific classification rules
- SLM preference settings
- LLM fallback configuration
- Audit logging and monitoring settings

### ✅ Quality Assurance

- ✅ Clippy validation with zero warnings
- ✅ Thread-safe async architecture
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Integration testing with existing systems
- ✅ TOML serialization validation

## Next Steps

1. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite for routing logic
2. **Performance Optimization**: Benchmarking and optimization
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time routing metrics
4. **Advanced Policies**: ML-based routing decisions
