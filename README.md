# Symbiont
*by ThirdKey*

Symbiont is a next-generation programming language and agent framework designed for AI-native, privacy-first software development. It empowers developers to build autonomous, policy-aware agents that can safely collaborate with humans, other agents, and large language models while enforcing zero-trust security, data privacy, and provable behavior through homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs.

With Symbiont, you're not just writing code — you're deploying intelligent, verifiable systems that explain, justify, and protect every decision they make.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker (for containerized development)
- Rust 1.88+ (if building locally)

### Running the Complete System

```bash
# Build the Docker container
docker build -t symbiont:latest .

# Run the development environment
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/workspace symbiont:latest bash

# Test the DSL parser
cd dsl && cargo run && cargo test

# Test the runtime system
cd ../runtime && cargo test

# Run example agents
cargo run --example basic_agent
cargo run --example full_system
```

    author = "ThirdKey"
    description = "Health data analysis agent"
}

agent analyze_health(input: HealthData) -> Result {
    capabilities = ["data_analysis", "health_metrics"]
    
    policy medical_privacy {
        allow: read(input) if input.anonymized == true
        deny: store(input) if input.contains_pii == true
        require: approval("medical_team") for sensitive_analysis
        audit: all_operations with signature
    }
    
    with memory = "persistent", privacy = "medical", requires = "moderator_approval" {
        if (llm_check_safety(input)) {
            result = analyze(input);
            audit_log("analysis_completed", result.metadata);
            return result;
        } else {
            audit_log("analysis_rejected", input.risk_score);
            return reject("Safety check failed");
        }
    }

```

### Key Components

- **Core Rust Engine**: High-performance, memory-safe foundation
- **Tree-sitter DSL**: Structured code manipulation through ASTs
- **Multi-tier Sandboxing**: Policy-driven isolation with three security levels
- **Cryptographic Audit**: Immutable trails with Ed25519 signatures
- **Agent Framework**: Autonomous, policy-aware agent orchestration
- **Context Manager**: Hierarchical memory and knowledge management
- **RAG Engine**: Retrieval-augmented generation for intelligent responses
- **Vector Database**: Semantic search and embedding storage

## 🧠 Context & Knowledge Systems

### Hierarchical Memory Architecture

Symbiont implements a sophisticated memory system with multiple layers:

- **Short-term Memory**: Recent interactions and immediate context
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent knowledge and learned patterns
- **Working Memory**: Active processing and temporary state
- **Episodic Memory**: Structured experiences and outcomes
- **Semantic Memory**: Factual knowledge and relationships

### RAG Engine Pipeline

    C --> D[Ranking]
    D --> E[Augmentation]
    E --> F[Generation]
    F --> G[Validation]
    G --> H[Response]
```

### Knowledge Sharing

Agents can securely share knowledge across security tiers with:
- **Trust Scoring**: Confidence-based knowledge validation
- **Access Control**: Policy-driven sharing permissions
- **Audit Trails**: Complete tracking of knowledge exchange
- **Encryption**: Secure knowledge transmission

## 🔒 Security Model

Symbiont implements a zero-trust security model with multiple layers:

1. **Tier 1 (Docker)**: Low-risk operations, basic isolation
2. **Tier 2 (gVisor)**: Default development tasks, enhanced security
3. **Tier 3 (Firecracker)**: High-risk operations, maximum isolation

All operations are cryptographically signed and audited for complete transparency.
