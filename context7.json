    "Symbiont uses a declarative DSL for agent definitions — metadata, agent blocks, policy blocks, and with-clauses for memory/security/timeout configuration",
    "Zero-trust by default: all inputs are untrusted, explicit allow/deny policies required, multi-tier sandboxing (Docker → gVisor → Firecracker)",
    "Policy-as-code: security rules are declared inline with 'policy' blocks containing allow, deny, require, and audit directives",
    "Workspace crates: runtime (core engine with http-input, http-api, vector-db features), dsl (parser + compiler), channel-adapter (Slack/Teams/Mattermost), repl-core/repl-cli/repl-lsp (REPL tooling)",
    "Webhook verification: HmacVerifier and JwtVerifier with provider presets for GitHub, Stripe, Slack — constant-time signature comparison",
    "Markdown memory persistence: agent context stored as markdown files with daily logs, retention-based compaction, and atomic writes",
    "Skill scanning: 10 built-in ClawHavoc security rules detect pipe-to-shell, env file references, SOUL.md tampering, eval+fetch, base64-decode-exec, rm-rf, chmod-777",
    "Metrics collection: FileMetricsExporter (atomic JSON), CompositeExporter (fan-out), background MetricsCollector — runtime exposes /metrics/snapshot, /metrics/scheduler, /metrics/system endpoints",
    "SchemaPin integration for MCP tool schema verification; AgentPin integration for agent identity credentials (ES256 only)",
    "Reasoning loop uses typestate-enforced ORGA cycle (Observe-Reason-Gate-Act) with compile-time phase transition safety — Reasoning → PolicyCheck → ToolDispatching → Observing",
    "Cedar policy gate (feature-gated behind 'cedar') uses cedar-policy crate Authorizer::is_authorized() for formal authorization — entity types: Agent (principal), Action (action), Resource (resource)",
    "Journal system emits all 7 LoopEvent variants (Started, ReasoningComplete, PolicyEvaluated, ToolsDispatched, ObservationsCollected, Terminated, RecoveryTriggered) for durable execution and crash recovery",
    "Knowledge bridge provides context-aware reasoning: vector-backed retrieval, automatic learning persistence, and knowledge-aware tool execution via KnowledgeAwareExecutor"
