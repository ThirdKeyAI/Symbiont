| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Symbiont, please report it to us privately.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@symbiont.dev
2. **Subject**: Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
3. **Content**: Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and provide an initial response within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue before any public disclosure
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will coordinate with you on the timing of public disclosure

### Security Best Practices

When using Symbiont in production:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest supported version
2. **Secrets Management**: Use the built-in secrets management system properly
3. **Sandboxing**: Enable and configure appropriate sandboxing levels
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. **Monitoring**: Enable audit logging and monitor for suspicious activity
6. **Network Security**: Run Symbiont in a properly secured network environment

### Security Features

Symbiont includes several security features:

- **Sandboxed Execution**: Isolated execution environments for agents
- **Secrets Management**: Encrypted storage and secure access to sensitive data
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events
- **Policy Engine**: Fine-grained access control and security policies
- **Signed Container Images**: Docker images are signed with cosign

### Security Considerations

- Symbiont executes arbitrary code as defined in agent configurations
- Ensure proper network isolation and access controls
- Regularly review and audit agent configurations
- Monitor system resources and API usage
- Use encryption for data at rest and in transit

## Vulnerability Management

We maintain an internal vulnerability management process:

1. **Triage**: Initial assessment and severity classification
2. **Investigation**: Technical analysis and impact assessment  
3. **Remediation**: Development and testing of fixes
4. **Release**: Security patches and coordinated disclosure
5. **Post-mortem**: Review process improvements

### Severity Classification

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, privilege escalation
- **High**: Information disclosure, authentication bypass
- **Medium**: Denial of service, local privilege escalation
- **Low**: Information leakage, minor security issues

## Third-Party Dependencies

We monitor our dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Review of dependency security advisories
- Prompt patching of vulnerable dependencies
